#Road Accident Analysis Dashboard
##Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design an interactive Excel-based dashboard that provides insights into road accident data. The dashboard helps analyze accident trends, severity, vehicle involvement, road conditions, and other factors, enabling data-driven decision making for safety improvements.
##Data set used

##Key Questions (KPIs)
1.	What is the total number of casualties (fatal, serious, and slight)?
2.	What percentage of casualties were caused by cars and other vehicle types?
3.	How do casualties vary by road type and surface condition?
4.	What are the temporal trends (monthly/yearly) in accident casualties?
5.	How do light conditions (day vs. night) affect casualty distribution?
6.	What is the distribution of casualties across rural vs. urban areas?
##Process
•	Data Collection: Accident dataset was gathered from reliable sources.
•	Data Cleaning: Removed inconsistencies, handled missing values, and formatted data.
•	Data Preparation: Created calculated columns and standardized fields for analysis.
•	Dashboard Development: Used Excel charts, pivot tables, and slicers to create interactive visualizations.
•	Insights Extraction: Interpreted results from charts and visualizations.
 
##Project Insights
•	Total casualties recorded: 417,883, with majority being slight casualties (86.8%).
•	Cars contributed to the highest number of casualties (177,681 cases).
•	Most accidents occurred on single carriageways (309.7k cases).
•	Dry road surfaces showed the highest casualties (279,445), followed by wet surfaces.
•	Daylight accounted for the majority of accidents (304,963 cases).
•	Urban areas had more casualties compared to rural regions.
•	Casualty trends showed seasonal variation with higher cases in early months.
